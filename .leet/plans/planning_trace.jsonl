do not use it as planning source\n</Planning Scope Rules>\n\n<Testing Requirements>\nFor EVERY new feature:\n1) Create test files:\n   - Python: tests/test_<module>.py using pytest\n   - TypeScript: __tests__/<module>.test.ts using Jest\n   - Other: Appropriate test framework for the language\n\n2) Tests must cover:\n\n   - Happy path scenarios\n   - Edge cases\n   - Error handling\n3) Run tests before merging:\n\n   - Python: pytest tests/\n   - TypeScript: npm test\n     </Testing Requirements>\n\n<Documentation Standards>\nREADME.md Updates\nWhen implementing a feature:\n- Add feature description under \"## Features\"\n- Include usage examples\n- Document any configuration needed\n- Update prerequisites if needed\n- Add a \"## Quick Start\" section early, including required env vars/credentials, `start.sh` and `stop.sh` usage, frontend URL output expectation, and a short CLI intro.\n\nPlan Store Management\n\n- Subtask status is derived from worklog events in /workspace/.leet/plans/\n- Prefer using planning tools (`leet_task_progress_update`, `leet_task_complete`) instead of manually editing worklog files.\n- If you write worklog records directly, event values MUST use canonical lowercase enum strings like `task-started` and `task-done` (never `TASK_STARTED`/`TASK_DONE`).\n- Plan files are named `plan.<task-slug>.md`; do not assume `plan.md` or `plan.txt`.\n- Newly discovered tasks should be added as subtask entries in the plan\n  </Documentation Standards>\n\n<Available Tools>\nTool availability is discovered at runtime by ToolManager from:\n- System local tools in /llmeds/src/leettools/common/mcp/tools\n- Extra tool directories (this app uses /app/tools)\n- User registered tool directories via leet_register_tools()\n- MCP servers defined in mcp.json (tools prefixed with mcp-<server>_)\n- You can also just run bash commands directly using shell_tools.run_shell_command() to install extra linux programs or do other operations.\n\nDecide which tools you may need to accomplish the tasks and request for their detailed usage if necessary.\n</Available Tools>\n\n<Development guides>\n- Always build the skeleton structure first, make sure the app runs end to end with minimal features.\n- For a single feature, always start from backend service, then frontend integration, make sure the feature can run end to end before polishing details.\n- Follow implementation instructions in `/app/guides`:\n-- backend service: `/app/guides/fastapi.dev.md`\n-- frontend development: `/app/guides/frontend.dev.md`\n-- develop customized tools: `/app/guides/customized_tools.md`\n</Development guides>\n\n<Important Reminders>\n- Always check `plan.summary.md` for summarized requirement status\n- Create commits frequently (after each logical change)\n- Never leave the codebase in a broken state\n- Document as you go, don't leave it for later\n- Run tests before every merge to main\n- Push changes regularly to save your work\n</Important Reminders>\n\n\n<Iteration Skill Plan>\nSelected subtask: none\nRequested skill preloads for this run:\n- `code-project-workflow`\n- `llmeds-frontend`\n- `llmeds-backend`\n</Iteration Skill Plan>\n\n\n[user]\n# Current Iteration Task Brief\n\n## Active Plan Subtask\nNo active subtask is currently selected;

[Most important next item]\n2. [Second priority]\n...\n\n## Recommended Next Action\n[Specific action to take next]\n```\n\n## After Analysis\n\nBased on your findings:\n\n1. If there are incomplete items in \"In Progress\":\n   - Continue working on them\n   - Update the plan store appropriately\n\n2. If \"In Progress\" is empty but \"Pending\" has items:\n   - Pick the highest priority pending subtask\n   - Start implementation\n\n3. If all items are complete:\n   - Verify all tests pass\n   - Ensure documentation is complete\n   - Update any remaining plan.summary.md checkboxes\n   - Report completion\n\n## Planning Scope Guardrails\n\nIf you modify `plan.summary.md` requirements, keep ONLY top-level implementation goals:\n- Keep total requirements concise (typically 3-8)\n- Exclude acceptance criteria / validation bullets from requirements\n- Do not create placeholder names like `step-1`, `step-2`, or `tasks`\n- Preserve detail for subtask-level planning inside each task directory later\n- Prefer updating plan store subtasks first; plan.summary.md should mirror plan state, not drive it\n\nRemember to always use the git workflow (feature branches, commits, merges) as you work.\n\n\nAfter the recheck, continue implementation with the active subtask as the immediate focus.\n", "output": "(pending)", "metadata": {"model": "gpt-5.1-codex-mini", "active_subtask_id": null, "pre_loaded_skills": ["code-project-workflow", "llmeds-frontend", "llmeds-backend"]}}
